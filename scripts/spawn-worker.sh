# Spawn a worker agent for a task in a new worktree.
#
# Usage: spawn-worker.sh <branch-name> <task-keyword> [step-scope]
# Example: spawn-worker.sh feature/clipboard-support clipboard
# Example: spawn-worker.sh feature/sync-role sync-interactive "Steps 1 and 2 only"
#
# Arguments:
#   branch-name:  Git branch to create/use
#   task-keyword: Keyword to match task file in spec/tasks/
#   step-scope:   (Optional) Specific steps this worker should handle.
#                 Appended to CLAUDE.md so the worker knows its scope.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Creates worktree under herdr's worktree base
#   2. Sets role marker in CLAUDE.md
#   3. Appends step scope if provided
#   4. Delegates to launch-agent.sh (herdr workspace + Claude setup)
