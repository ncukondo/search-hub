## Development Flow

1. **Create task file**: `spec/tasks/YYYYMMDD-NN-task-name.md` using `_template.md`
2. **Link in roadmap**: Update "Task File" column above
3. **Implement with TDD**: Follow the cycle in `_template.md` (Red → Green → Refactor)
4. **Update checkboxes**: Mark steps complete in task file
5. **Complete task**: Update status here, move task file to `completed/`

## Notes

- See `_template.md` for TDD cycle, step structure, and task file format
- Test files are co-located with source files (`*.test.ts`)
